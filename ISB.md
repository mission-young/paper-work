## Isospin-symmetry breaking in superallowed Fermi beta decay due to isospin-nonconserving forces



交换质子和中子数能级简并预示着同位旋对称性的存在。

The degeneracies of energy levels in nuclei with interchanging number of protons and neutrons indicate the existence of isospin sysmetry.

由于上、下夸克的质量和电磁相互作用属性的差异，在QCD(量子色动力学)中，同位旋对称性产生了破缺。

Isospin symmetry is broken in QCD due to the mass difference between the up and down quarks and their electromagnetic interaction.

在原子核中，库仑相互作用和电荷依赖的核子核子相互作用破坏了对称性，产生了可观测的效应。

In nuclei,the Coulome interaction and the charge-dependent nucleon-nucleon interaction break this symmetry, giving rise to observable effects.

尤其对于临近N=Z的线，基态和激发态都被同位旋对称性破缺所影响。

Especially for nuclei near the N=Z line, both the ground states and excited spectra are affected by isospin-symmetry breaking(ISB).

因而，调研远离稳定线的丰质子核可用于检验ISB效应。

Therefore, investigation of proton-rich nuclei far from the line of stability provides important testing ground for ISB effects.

同位旋对称性破缺在多体系统中体现为非零的库伦置换能和三体置换能。

It has been known that ISB in nuclear many-body systems in terms of the isospin nonconserving(INC) interactions leads to non-zero Coulomb displacement energy (CDE) and triplet displacement displacement energy(TDE).

同位旋不守恒的的微观起因有待去理解，这些需要引入核结构的多体效应的知识。

While the microscopic origin of possible INC sources is yet to be understood, study of these quantities must involve the knowledge of the many-body effects in nuclear structure.

这意味着对于ISB的进一步了解，包含INC的细致的壳模型计算是必要。

This suggests that the detailed shell-model calculations with an inclusion of INC forces are essential for further refining our knowledge about ISB.

最近，在解释f7/2壳的CDE和TDE特征中，T=1,j=0的INC相互作用扮演者重要角色。

Recently, it has been shown that the INC interaction of the T=1,J=0 channel plays an important role in the explanation of characteristic behavior of the f7/2-shell CDE’s and TDE’s.

镜像能量差异和三态能量差异在先前f7/2壳被研究过。

Mirror energy differences(MED’s) and triplet energy differences (TED’s) were previously studies in the f7/2-shell, and have been investigated by us for the upper fp-shell nuclei.

对于轻核而言，镜像能量差与弱束缚的s1/2质子有关，这个质子减少了库伦排斥因而强烈影响了对应核的镜像质量差。

On the other hand, for light nuclei the MED’s have been discussed in the relation with the loosely bound s1/2 proton, which reduces the Coulomb repulsion and  hence strongly influences the MED’s of the corresponding nuclei.

sd壳的镜像质量差相比于fp壳可能有不同的起源。

We remark that  the MED’s in the sd-shell could have a different origin from that in the fp-shell.

鉴于合适的放射性和ISB效应，超允许β衰变在检验CKM混合矩阵元Vud精确值中扮演者重要角色。

Superallowed Fermi beta-decay serves as a crucial nuclear input to test the precise values of the CKM mixing matrix element Vud between the u and d quarks, provided that the radiative and ISB effects are considered properly.

在大多数实验和理论中，ISB的修正小于2%，核素无关的Ft值被认为是常数。

In most experiments and theories, the correction due to ISB is known to be smaller than 2%, the nucleus-indepent Ft values are found to be consistent.

然而，最近在32Cl和31Cl的超允许费米beta跃迁中，发现了很大的ISB效应。

However, recent data have indicated an anomalously large ISB effect in the superallowed Fermi beta-decay of 32Cl and 31Cl.

32Cl到32S的IAS态产生5.3%的修正项目，31Cl到31S的较大的同位旋混合也被观测到。

An unusually large correction 5.3% has been reported for the Fermi beta decay form 32Cl to the T=1 isobaric analog state in 32S, and  a large isospin mixing has been observed for the beta-decay from 31Cl to the T=3/2 IAS in 31S.

这些结果可能依赖于同位旋不守恒力和混合的态的位置。

It should be noted that these results may depend on both INC force and location of the states that mix.

态间的近简并能够提高同位旋混合，这一点并不需要很强的同位旋不守恒力。

An accidental near-degeneracy of the states could enhance isospin mixing,without requiring a particularly strong INC force.

利用超允许费米跃迁的实验数据，通过微扰理论，能够用来提取同位旋非守恒力混合矩阵元。

This can be estimated by using the perturbation theory, which, subsequently, can be applied to extract the INC mixing matrix element from the experimental data of the superallowed Fermi beta-decays.

A=23的较强的同位旋混合依旧很有争议。关于上述的一个一致性的理解要求sd壳的细致的壳模型计算。

Furthermore，the observation of the strong isospin mixing for A=23 is still controversial. A consistent understanding of all the above requires detailed shell-model calculations for the sd-shell region.

为了理解超允许费米beta跃迁的异常，我们调研了库伦置换能查和三态置换能差。

In order to understand these anomalies in the superallowed Fermi beta-decay, we first investigate CDE’s and TDE’s for ground and isobaric analogue states in an isospin multiplet for the total isospin T, with Tz=(N-Z)/2 specifying different states of isospin projection in the multiplet. CDE and TDE are defined as

BE为负的基态和激发态的结合能。因此在CDE中，质子与中子进行交换，Tz> 为较大z的同重核。 

Where BE are the negative binding energies of ground and isobaric analogue states. Here in the CDE’s p protons exchange with neutrons, and Tz> is the Tz for the large Z isobar in a mirror pair.

从定义中可以看到，第一个是镜像结合能差异，第二个仅仅对三重态有意义。

From the definitions , one sees that while the first quantity resembles differences in mirror binding energies, the second is meaningful only for triplets. 

在我们的标记中，同位旋多重态的自旋和宇称被暗中包含了但是在上述表示式中被简化忽略了。

In our notation, the total spin and parity Ipi of the isobaric multiplets are implicitly included, but omitted in above equations for simplicity.

在图一中，实验的sd壳的CDE被展示，结合能是Tz=+-1/2的基态对的结合能。

In fig1, the experimental CDE’s for the sd-shell with T=-Tz>=,p=1 are shown, where the binding energies are those of the ground states of a mirror pair with Tz=+1/2.



我们执行了壳模型计算，考虑了电荷无关相互作用、T=1，j=0的同位旋矢量和张量相互作用。

In the following, we perform shell-model calculations with the charge-independent interaction USDA(H0) and additional isovector and isotensor T=1,J=0 INC interaction(HINC).

同位旋非对称力强度被用来拟合实验的从sd壳的结合能数据中提取的CDE和TDE。

The INC force strengths are fitted to the experimental CDE's and TDE's that are extracted from the binding -energy data of the sd-shell. 

在描述实验的CDE和TDE之后，我们用更加敏感的CDE/Z和TDE/Z来调整INC力。

After the experimental CDE's and TDE's are described, we then use the more sensitive quantities CDE/Z and TDE/Z to adjust the INC forces finely.



HINC takes the form of a spherical tensor of rank two .

Vc是库仑相互作用，Hsp是单粒子哈密顿量，其包括质子的库仑单粒子能和电磁自选轨道相互作用引起的单粒子能偏移。

Vc Coulomb interaction.Hsp the single-particle Hamiltonian that include the coulomb single-particle energy shifts due to the electromagnetic spin-orbit interaction.

在sd模型空间，质子的单粒子能被取作ed5/2=3.6,es1/2=3.55,ed3/2=3.6 MeV.

The Coulomb single-particle energies for protons are taken as for the sd model space.

同位旋不守恒力的两体矩阵元，对于k=1、2分别对应着同位旋向量和同位旋张量。

The two-body matrix elements of the INC interaction VINC with k=1 and k=2 for the isovector and isotensor component, respectively, are related to those in the proton-neutron formalism through



更多的两体电荷相关相互作用被提出。

We note that more general two-body charge-dependent interactions have been proposed.

正如先前处理fp区域的方案，我们采用INC同位旋矢量和张量来处理每个轨道。

As our previous treatment for the upper fp shell region, we adopt the INC isovector and isotensor interactions with T=1,j=0 for each orbit(here a,b= d5/2,s1/2,d3/2). 

随后，仅仅对角矩阵元被考虑，非对角元被忽略。

Subsequently, only then diagonal interaction matrix elements are considered and off-diagonal ones are negelected.

计算通过MSHELL64来进行奇质量核(T=1/2,3/2,5/2,7/2)和偶质量核(T=1,2,3)sd壳模型计算。

Calculations are performed with the shell model code MSHELL64 for odd-mass nuclei with odd-neutron number and isospin T=1/2,3/2,5/2 and 7/2, and for even-mass nuclei with T=1,2 and 3 in the sd model space.

Fig1 展示了sd壳(A=18-39)的计算结果. 不考虑INC相互作用的CDE 曲线位于数据点的下方。

Fig1 shows the calculated results for sd-shell nuclei with mass A=18-39. As one can see from Fig1, the CDE curve calculated without the INC forces lies below the data points.

这证实了著名的"Nolen-schiffer Anomaly"，即使考虑了库仑相互作用等修正，也会低估。

This reconfirms the well-known "Nolen-schiffer Anomaly" , which states that there remains a consistent under-estimate of the CDE's,even after the Coulomb interaction and all the related corrections were taken into accout.

包含INC显著地提升曲线到数据点上方，与实验数据吻合较好。

The calculations with the INC forces clearly shift the curve up to a point that the theoretical results agree nicely with data.

从图1中，可以推断T=1，j=0同位旋矢量INC相互作用对CDE/Z不敏感。从图1可以看出，有没有INC相互作用差异不大。

For Fig1, one may conclude that the T=1,j=0 isovector INC interactions are not very sensitive to the quantity CDE/Z, because, as one can see from Fig1, the calculated patterns with and without the INC forces are not very different.

TDE对INC比较敏感。Fig1b显示不包含INC的计算明显偏离实验数据。

However，TDE is found to be a more sensitive probe for the INC interactions. Fig1b depicts that calculations without INC deviate significantly from the data, especially for the upper branch in the staggering pattern.

通过包含INC相互作用，TDE与实验数据符合的相当好。

By including the INC interactions，an excellent agreement with the experimental data for TDE's of the mass region A=18-38 can be obtained, as Fig1b and Fig1d, the experimental  TDE/Z are also better reproduced by considering the INC interactions. 

实验数据与CDE与TDE的rms偏差为66keV、34keV。

The rms deviations between the calculated and experimental CDE's and TDE's are 66 keV and 34 keV, respectively. 

T=1，J=0 INC 相互作用是重要的。似乎用于描述sd壳的CDE和TDE的行为是足够的。

Thus we have demonstrated, consistent with previous finding,that T=1,J=0 INC interactions are important, and seem to be efficient, for describing the characteristic behaviors in CDE's and TDE's of the sd-shell. 

然而，我们强调INC非零对于其他观测是需要的，这是下一个讨论的核心内容。

Nevertheless, we stree that INC forces with nonzero spin may be needed for the other observations, which is the central theme of the next discussion.

有效的INC相互作用壳模型计算对于激发态的多重态也同样适用。

To demonstate that the present shell-model calculations with the chosen effective INC interactions work also for the excited multiplet states in this mass  region, we list in Table 1 the CDE's and TDE's for the ground and excited multiplet states in A=22,23,29-32. 

这些质量数被选择，因为我们感兴趣的核在这个区域，超允许跃迁费米beta跃迁被观测到。这将会在下一章被讨论。

These mass numbers are chosen because they involve the isotopes of our present interest(31Cl,32Cl and 23Al), for which transition strengths in superallowed Fermi beta-decay were observed, and these will be the main focus of our discussion in the later sections. 

例如，A=31和I=3/2的CDE用来计算，包含包含同位旋相似态的子核31S in Fermi 跃迁，

For example,the CDE of A=31 with I=3/2 shown in Table 1 is calculated for T=3/2, Tz=-1/2,p=1 using Eq.1, which involves the isobaric analogue state of the daughter nucleus 31S in the Fermi beta-decay of 31Cl, which will be discussed later in Fig3b. 

计算CDE和TDE与实验数据符合的较好，除了A=32，岐离较大。

As one can see in Table 1, the calculated CDE's and TDE's are in a reasonably good agreement with the experimental data, except for A=32, where larger discrepancies are observed.

通过联合壳模型CDE和实验已知的丰中子同重素，对应丰质子的同重素的的质子分离能能够被计算。

By combining the shell-model  CDE(A,T) with the experimentally-know BE(ATTz=T) of the neutron-richer isobars,BE of the corresponding proton-richer isobars can be calculated, and their one- and two- proton seperation energies can thereby be obtained.

Fig2展示了122个单质子、双质子分离能，分别标注在盒子的第一、第二个数。其中72有数据，50个是我们的预测。

Fig2 shows a total number of 122 one- and two-proton separation energies denoted in each box by the first and second numbers, respectively. Among them, 72 have data to compare with and 50 are our predictions. 

我们发现计算的和实验的单双质子分离能与实验吻合的比较好，rms分别为94keV和148keV。

We have found that the calculated and experimental one- and two-proton separation energies agree very well within a rms deviation of about 94 kev and 148kev,respectively.

壳模型计算中不引入INC相互作用，sp和s2p的rms偏差增加了18.5和30.9keV。

without the T=1，j=0 INC force in the calculation, the rms deviations for Sp and S2p increase by 18.5 keV and 30.9 keV，respectively. 

对于几个丰质子核，例如 26,27S, 30Ar,and 34,35Ca，偏差会达到200keV。

It is to be noted that several proton-rich nuclei, for example 26,27S, 30Ar,and 34,35Ca, however, exhibit large discrepancies by about 200keV. 

红色的线代表质子滴线，单双质子分离能为负值。

The thick(red) line represent the proton drip-line beyound which the one-proton and/or two-proton separation energies become negative. 

FIg2页显示在 sd壳质量区的几个质子反射核。

Fig2 also suggests several candidates for proton emitters in the sd-shell mass region. 

与我们的结果一致，两个质子非束缚同位素30Ar和29Cl已经被证实，结构上未被同位旋对称性。

Consistent with our results, two new proton-unbound isotope 30Ar and 29Cl have recently been identified, pointing to a violation of isobaric symmetry in the structure.

费米beta跃迁提供关键的观测来证实同位旋对称性，超允许费米beta跃迁矩阵元M0对应着同位旋对称性。

Fermi beta-decay provides one of the critical observations to probe isospin symmetry,which leads to strict selection rules for superallowed Fermi transition with the matrix element M0 corresponding to the isospin sysmetry.

然而，由于同位旋对称性破却，费米矩阵元修改，c为修正因子，期待能够包含所有的对称性破却，一般小于2%。

 However,due to ISB, the Fermi matrix element for the transition is modified as ,where c called isospin-breaking effects, 

对于理论计算而言，模型空间需要非常大，因为自然界中库仑力是个长程力。但大模型空间计算是不可能的，考虑到组态的巨大纬度。

the model space has to be very large because , in the first place, the Coulomb force is long range in nature. Calculation in a large shell-model space are not possible due to huge dimensions of configuration. 

Hardy 和Towner 睿智地将c分为两项，c1，c2. c1 包括了严格壳模型空间下的的组态混合，c2包含外部混合，c2通过计算质子半径和中子径向函数的重叠积分。

Hardy and Towner the wisely divided c into two parts, c=c1+c2,where c1 arises from configuration mixing in a restricted shell-model space and c2 separately contributes from the mixing with outside, which is estimated by computing radial overlap integrals with proton and neutron radial functions.

23Cl-》32S 费米跃迁，c=5.39，ft=3200s，比很多其他的超允许费米跃迁要高。

Recently, it has been reported that the isospin-breaking correction c=5.39% for the observed ft=3200s in the Fermi transition from 32Cl to 32S is anamalously larger than the typical values observed in many other superallowed decays. 

低激发态T=1，I=1+和T=0，I=1+态分离能为188.2keV 的32S显著提升了同位旋混合和同位旋破却修正系数。

It has been suggested that the closely-lying excited T=1,I=1+ and T=0,I=1+ states with the energy separation 188.2 in 32S greatly enhances the isospin mixing, and also the isospin-breaking correction.

在近期文章中，31Cl的beta延迟gamma衰变实验中，较大的同位旋混合被观测到。

 In another very recent work, a large isospin mixing has been observed in 31Cl beta delayed gamma-ray decay experiment.. 

在T=1/2 和T=3/2态I=3/2+之间具有较大的同位旋混合。

The investigation indicates a large isospin mixing between the T=1/2 and T=3/2 states with spin-parity I=3/2. 

31Cl和31S 当T=3/2时，MF2=2.4,M0=3，当T=1/2时，MF2=0.48，M02=0.这意味着可观的同位旋混合。

the matrix element of the Fermi transition between 32Cl and 32S has been observed as ,while the symmetry-limit values ,suggesting a considerable isospin mixing. 

另一方面，早期的23Al实验中23Mg的IAS态T=3/2，logft=3.31，MF2=3.0. 相比以上两个实验，显示没有同位旋混合。

On the other hand, an early 23Al beta_decay experiment populated the T=3/2 IAS in 23Mg with a logft of 3.31,corresponding to 3.0. In contrast to the two. experiments mentioned above, the 23Al beta decay results suggests no isospin-mixing.

为了理解这些实验数据，费米矩阵元被计算。

To understand these experimental data, Fermi matrix element are calculated. 

c1可以从c1=MF2/M02, M02=2(T=1),M02=3(T=3/2). 

C1 can be obtained from c1,where .

考虑T=1，j=0的INC相互作用，32Cl-》32S 21Cl-》31S 对应的MF2=2 、3 ，非常接近对称极限值。

With the T=1,j=0 INC interactions,the calculated Fermi transition matrix elements for 32Cl->32S and 31Cl->31S yield almost ,very close to the symmetry-limit values. 

这个结果不是我们预期的。

These results are totally unexpected. 

因而我们必须回答问题，为什么超允许费米beta跃迁无法通过sd壳的J=0 INC相互作用来描述。

Thus we must answer the question why the superallowed Fermi transitions can't be described by the j=0 INC interacitons for the sd shell 

在f7/2壳中，Bentley 引入J依赖的INC相互作用来调研镜像能量差异。

in the f7/2 shell , Bentley introduced a J-depedent INC interaction in the investigation of mirror energy. 

进一步，产生了结构相关的议题。WS势的计算显示，对于弱束缚的丰质子核，仅仅与s1/2轨道相关的两体相互作用应该被修正。

Moreover,there have been structure issues because the calculations with the  Woods-Saxon potential showd that only two-body interaction related to the s1/2 orbit should be modified for the loose-bound proton-rich nuclei. 

这个给我们一个灵感，对于反常的超允许beta跃迁数据，考虑与s1/2轨道相关的J-依赖INC相互作用可能是需要的。

These previous investigations gives us a hint that J-depedent INC interactions related to the s1/2 orbit may be needed to explain the anomalous superallowed beta-decay data.

我们现在考虑下额外的同位旋矢量和同位旋张量INC相互作用，考虑s1/2轨道对应的T=1，J=1,2,3.并且假设一个常数的强度量。

We now consider additional isovector and isotensor INC interactions, with T=1,J=1,2,3,related to the s1/2 orbit, and assume a common strength with the same sign for simplicity. 

对于T=1，J>3的项不列入讨论，因为较高的J值不在sd壳的s1/2轨道耦合之类。

The T=1 INC interactions with J larger than 3 do not enter into the discussion simply because such high J values are outside the coupling with the s1/2 orbit within the sd-shell. 

我们发现仅仅J=2和3对31Cl、32CL的超允许费米跃迁有影响，J=1的贡献可以忽略。

we found that only the J=2 and 3 terms influence the superallowed Fermi transition for 31Cl and 32Cl beta-decays, while the contribution from the J=1 term is negligibly small.

为了重现31Cl和32Cl费米跃迁的实验强度，计算结果显示对J=2和J=3的结合项不敏感，并且Vsj=2=100keV和Vsj=3=0 能够很好地吻合数据。

Furthermore,our calculation shows that to reproduce the experimantal data of the Fermi transition strengths for both 31Cl and 32Cl beta decays, the calculated results are insensitive to the combination of the J=2 and J=3 terms, and the parameters V=100 and V=0 seem to reproduce the data.

因此，我们采用T=1，J=2相互作用。以后的演技，或许其他的J值需要考虑。

 Therefore, we adopt only the T=1,J=2 INC interaction for the present case,with a remark that further investigation with other J values may be necessary for other cases.

最后我们发现，T=1，J=2INC相互作用在CDE和TDE的影响很小，先前的结论不受影响。

 Finally, we have checked, and found that the effects of additional isovector and isotensor T=1,J=2 INC interactions on the CDE's and TDE's are negligibly small. Therefore,the conclusions drawn earlier are not affected.

图3显示32Cl同位旋破却修正c1和31Cl费米跃迁强度MF2 与Vs的函数关系。

Fig3 shows the isospin-breaking correction c1 for the 32Cl beta-decay and the Fermi transition strengths MF2 for 31Cl beta-decay as a function of Vs.

Vsj=2 为0，c1是小的，MF2=0，T=1/2, MF2=3,T=3/2.

 with zero vsj=2,c1 is small and mf2=0(3) for T=1/2(3/2). 

c1 灵敏依赖Vsj=2，随着VsJ=2的增加，T=1/2的MF2增加、T=3/2的MF2减少。

The c1 values depends sensitively on Vsj=2 and the mf2 for T=1/2(T=3/2) smoothly increases(decrease)with increasing Vsj=2. 

当VsJ=2=100时，c1=4.39。通过USDA计算获得c2=0.865. c=5.26, 这个和实验数据5.3(9)吻合的相当好。

At vsj=2=100keV,the isospin-breaking correction becomes c1=4.39%. By employing the values of c2=0.865% obtained with USDA by melconian., the total isospin-breaking correction is c=5.26%. This value agrees with the experimental data remarkably well. 

对于31Cl，T=3/2 MF2=2.49,T=1/2 MF2=0.47, 也与实验吻合的较好。

For the 31Cl beta-decay calculated with Vsj=2=100keV,our results show MF2=2.49 for T=3/2 and mf2=0.47 for T=1/2,which are also in good agreement with the experiments. 

对于23Al，计算的MF2=2.97，logft=3.32. 同样的包含vsj=2的计算也重现实验，显示23Al较小的同位旋混合。

For the 23Al beta-decay, the calculated value is mf2=2.97,which indicates a logft of 3.32. Thus same calculation (with inclusion of the additional isovector and isotensor T=1 j=2 INC interactions related to the s1/2 orbit and the same strength Vsj=2) also reproduces correctly the experimental suggested small isospin mixing in 23Al.

随着超允许费米跃迁较好的描述实验数据，我们可以进一步利用微扰理论来评估同位旋混合。

With the good description of the superallowed Fermi transition data, we can further use the perturbation theory to estimate the isospin admixture in a two-level mixing model, with the mixed states expressed by 

IAS和nonIAS分别表示同位旋相似态和非同位旋相似态。theta是混合角度。

IAS and nonIAS are the isobaric-analogue and non-isobaric-analogue states, respectively, and the theta is the mixing angle. 

Ref24中，混合矩阵元v能够通过v=esin(2theta)/2获得。theta=MF2b/MF2a, e为IAS和nonIAS态能量差。

Following Ref24, the mixing matrix element v=<IAS|VINC|nonIAS> can be obtained as v=Esin(2theta)/2 from tan2theaa= and the energy separation e between IAS and non-IAS states. 

对于31Cl，v=30keV，实验数据为41keV。32Cl，v=37.6，实验36.8keV。

For the 31Cl decay, our calculated value v=30keV compares well with the experimental result v=41keV. For the 32Cl decay, our value v=37.6 argees remarkably with the experimental one v=36.8 keV. 

因而我们可以推断，T=1,j=2 INC 相互作用能够用来理解超允许费米跃迁令人困惑的观测现象。

We can thus conclude that T=1,J=2 INC interactions with a single parameter can consistently be used to understand the puzzling observations in superallowed Fermi transition.

上述结果论证了除了INC力自身，核物理结构的重要性。不同的轨道占据感受到的INC力是不同的。

The above results have demonstrated the importance of nuclear structure issues apart from the INC force itself. Nuclei with different orbit-occupations may feel the INC force differently. 

在31Cl和32Clβ衰变中，由于T=1，J=2 INC相互作用，d3/2轨道占据衰减。

In the 31Cl and 32Cl beta-decays, the occupation of transformed protons in the d3/2 orbit decreases due to the T=1,J=2 INC interaction.

通过抑制费米矩阵元，MF2 3.0 到2.49 31Cl，MF2 2.0 到 1.91 32Cl, 影响费米跃迁。

This influences the Fermi beta-decay transitions by suppressing the fermi matrix elements mf2 from 3.0 t0 2.49for the 31Cl decay and from 2.0 to 1.91 for the 32Cl decay.

对于23Al帅版，d5/2轨道被T=1,J=2 INC相互作用影响较小，因而ISB效应可以忽略。因而同样的计算可以一致性解释，为什么Cl是大的，而23Al是小的。

 For the 23Al decay, however, the transformed protons from the last occupied d5/2 orbit are affected very little by the T=1,J=2 INC interaction, and therefore, the ISB effect becomes negligibly small. Thus the same calculation can consistently explain why the ISB effect is large for Cl but small for 23Al.

我们指出计算是包含自由参数的。尽管库仑单粒子能和每一项都有明确的含义，确定的强度被用来拟合实验数据。

We point out that the present calculations involve free parameters. Although the Coulomb single-particle energies and each term in Eq have well-defined meanings, the strengths are determined phenomenologically by fitting to data.

有必要去研究这个参数的来源，来调研同位旋对称性破却的意义。

 It is very much desired to understand the origin of the parameters, which should be investigated with the realistic forces that properly contain the isospin-violating components.

总的来说，我们通过执行sd壳区域的壳模型计算调研了同位旋不守恒力在库仑置换能、三体置换能、超允许费米跃迁的效用。

In summary, we have investigated the effects of isospin non conserving forces on Coulomb displacement energy, triplet displacement energy, and super allowed fermi beta-decay by perfroming detailed shell-model calculations for the sd-shell region. 

同位旋守恒USDA有效相互作用，和库仑T=1，J=0同位旋不守恒力被应用。

The isospin invariant USDA effective interaction, together with the Coulomb plus the T=1,j=0 isospin-nonconserving forces are employed.

通过一些符合较好的INC强度数据，实验的CDE、TED能够在整个区域温和的较好。INC力在sd壳是重要的，并且考虑T=1,J=0 的INC力似乎已经足够用来描述CDE和TDE。

 We have shown that with a few fitted INC strength, the experimental  CDE and TDE data of the entire mass region can be described with high accuracy. We conclude that the INC force is important for the sd-shell and inclusion of the T=1,j=0 INC force seems to be sufficient for the description of CDE and TDE. 

基于CDE计算，我们计算了在sd质量区的122个单双质子分离能。确定了质子滴线，并且给出了可能的质子发射核。

Based on the CDE calculation, we have further calculated a total of 122 one- and two-proton separation energies of the sd-shell mass region. We have explicitly shown the location of proton drip-lines and suggested potential candidates for proton emitter. 

但是0自旋的INC力不能解释三个超允许费米跃迁 31Cl、32Cl和23Al. 我们最终证实了这些存在的异常能够通过加上T=1，J=2 INC相互作用，其在d5/2质子轨道和s1/2中子轨道。我们发现计算的混合矩阵元与cl的吻合较好。因而可以得出结论，在超允许费米跃迁中的异常行为是由于T=1,J=2iNC力引起的能级混合。

However, the calculation with the zero-spin INC force could not explain the three superallowed Fermi beta-decay experiments in 31Cl,32Cl and 23Al. We have domenstrated finally that these existing anomalies found in the supper allowed beta-decay experiments can only be understood with additional T=1,j=2 INC interaction that acts between the d5/2 prootn and the s1/2 neutron orbit. We have. Found that the calculated mixing matrix elements by shell model are in good agreement with the experimentally extracted ones for the 31Cl and 32Cl decays, and thus we conclude that the anomalous behaviors in the superallowed beta-decay can be understood by the level mixing due to the T=1,J=2 INC force.

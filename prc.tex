    \textbf{Abstract:}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The $\beta$-decay properties of the neutron-deficient nuclei {\color{red}$^{25}$Si and $^{26}$P} {\color{blue}$^{22}$Al} have been investigated at {\color{red}the GANIL/LISE3 facility} {\color{blue}Radioactive Ion Beam Line in Lanzhou (RIBLL)} by means of charged-particle and $\gamma$-ray spectroscopy. The decay schemes obtained and the Garrow-Teller strength distributions are compared to shell-model calculations based on the USD interaction. $B(GT)$ values derived from the absolute measurement of the $\beta$-decay braching ratios give rise to a quenching factor of the Gamow-Teller strength of {\color{red}0.6}{\color{blue}null}. A precise half-life of {\color{red}43.7(6)}{\color{blue}null} ms was detemined for {\color{red}$^{26}$P}{\color{blue}$^{22}$Al},the $\beta$-(2)$p$ decay mode of which is described.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Over the last decades, $\beta$-decay properties of light unstable nuclei have been extensively investigated in order to probe their single-particle nuclear structure and to establish the proton and neutron drip lines.

\end{enumerate}

$\star\star\star\star shell model  \star\star\star\star$

Hence, compilation of spectroscopic properites are available for many $sd$ shell nuclei from which nucleon-nucleon interactions were derived. $\beta$-decay studies of nuclei having a large proton excess are therefore useful to test the validity of these models when they are applied to very unstable nuclei.

$\star\star\star\star reduced transition probability ft \star\star\star\star$

Moreover, in the standard V-A description of $\beta$-decay, a direct link between experiment results and fundamental constants of the weak interaction is given by the reduced transition probability $ft$ of the individual allowed $\beta$-decays. This parameter,which incorporates the phase space factor $f$ and the parital half-life $t=T_{1/2}/\rm{B.R}$. ($T_{1/2}$ being the total half-life of the decaying nucleus and B.R. the branching ratio associated with the $\beta$ transition considered), can be written as follow:

$\star\star\star\star~equation~ft~\star\star\star\star$

\begin{equation}
    ft=\frac{\kappa}{g^{2}_{V}\Big|\langle f|\tau|i \rangle\Big|^{2}+g^{2}_{A}\Big|\langle f|\sigma\tau|i \rangle\Big|^{2}}
\end{equation}

$\star\star\star\star~ft~explanation~\star\star\star\star$

where $\kappa$ is a constant and where $g_{V}$ and $g_{A}$ are, respectively, the vector and axial-vector current coupling constants related to the Fermi and Gamow-Teller components of $\beta$-decay. $\tau$ and $\sigma$ are the isospin and the spin operators, respectively. 

$\star\star\star\star~ft~meanings~\star\star\star\star$

Hence, the comparison of the measured $ft$ values and the computed Fermi and Gamow-Teller matrix elements appears to be a good test of nuclear wave fucntions built in the shell-model frame, stressing the role of the overlap between initial and final nuclear states as well as the configuration mixing occurring in parent and daughter states. 

$\star\star\star\star~mirror~asymmetry~anomaly~and~quenching~of~the~GT~strength~\star\star\star\star$

However, two systematic deviations from theoretical predictions shows the limitation of our theoretical understanding and treatment of fundamental interactions. They are reported as the \textit{mirror asymmetry anomaly in $\beta$} and the \textit{quenching of the Gamow-Teller strength}.

$\star\star\star\star~Mirror~asymmetry~in~\beta~decay~\star\star\star\star$

\textit{Mirror asymmetry in $\beta$-decay}: This phenomenon is related to the isospin non-conserving forces acting in the atomic nucleus. If nuclear forces were charge independent, the $\beta^{+}$(EC) and $\beta^{-}$ decays of analog states belonging to mirror nuclei would be of equal strength. The deviation from this simple picture is characterized by the asymmetry parameter $\delta=\left( ft^{+}/ft^{-}-1 \right)$, where the + and - signs are associated with the decay of the proton- and the neutron- rich members of the mirror pair, respectively. Figure 1 presents an updated systematic of $\delta$ values measured for mirror nuclei with A $\leq$ 40. Thirty-nine allowed Gamow-Teller mirror transitions with log(\textit{ft}) $\leq$ 6 pertaining to 14 pairs of a mean deviation of about 5\% for these nuclei lying in the $p$ and $sd$ shells. The asymmetry reaches 11(1)\% if only $p$ shell nuclei are considered, which stresses the interplay between the Coulomb and the centrifugal barriers.

    The $\beta$-decay properties of the neutron-deficient/proton-rich nuclei $^{22}\textnormal{Al}$ have been investigated at  Radioactive Ion Beam Line in Lanzhou (RIBLL) by means of charged-particle and $\gamma$-ray spectroscopy.The precise half-life of $^{22}\textnormal{Al}$, the excitation energies energies, $\beta$-feeding intensities, $\textnormal{log}\left( ft \right)$ values and Gamow-Teller transition strengths for the states of $^{22}\textnormal{Mg}$ populated in the $\beta$ decay of $^{22}\textnormal{Al}$ were determined.The decay schemes obtained and the Garrow-Teller strength distributions are compared to shell-model calculations based on the recently-developed USD$^{*}$ interaction.

交换质子和中子数能级简并预示着同位旋对称性的存在。

The degeneracies of energy levels in nuclei with interchanging number of protons and neutrons indicate the existence of isospin sysmetry.

由于上、下夸克的质量和电磁相互作用属性的差异，在QCD(量子色动力学)中，同位旋对称性产生了破缺。

Isospin symmetry is broken in QCD due to the mass difference between the up and down quarks and their electromagnetic interaction.

在原子核中，库仑相互作用和电荷依赖的核子核子相互作用破坏了对称性，产生了可观测的效应。

In nuclei,the Coulome interaction and the charge-dependent nucleon-nucleon interaction break this symmetry, giving rise to observable effects.

尤其对于临近N=Z的线，基态和激发态都被同位旋对称性破缺所影响。

Especially for nuclei near the N=Z line, both the ground states and excited spectra are affected by isospin-symmetry breaking(ISB).

因而，调研远离稳定线的丰质子核可用于检验ISB效应。

Therefore, investigation of proton-rich nuclei far from the line of stability provides important testing ground for ISB effects.

同位旋对称性破缺在多体系统中体现为非零的库伦置换能和三体置换能。

It has been known that ISB in nuclear many-body systems in terms of the isospin nonconserving(INC) interactions leads to non-zero Coulomb displacement energy (CDE) and triplet displacement displacement energy(TDE).

同位旋不守恒的的微观起因有待去理解，这些需要引入核结构的多体效应的知识。

While the microscopic origin of possible INC sources is yet to be understood, study of these quantities must involve the knowledge of the many-body effects in nuclear structure.

这意味着对于ISB的进一步了解，包含INC的细致的壳模型计算是必要。

This suggests that the detailed shell-model calculations with an inclusion of INC forces are essential for further refining our knowledge about ISB.

最近，在解释f7/2壳的CDE和TDE特征中，T=1,j=0的INC相互作用扮演者重要角色。

Recently, it has been shown that the INC interaction of the T=1,J=0 channel plays an important role in the explanation of characteristic behavior of the f7/2-shell CDE’s and TDE’s.

镜像能量差异和三态能量差异在先前f7/2壳被研究过。

Mirror energy differences(MED’s) and triplet energy differences (TED’s) were previously studies in the f7/2-shell, and have been investigated by us for the upper fp-shell nuclei.

对于轻核而言，镜像能量差与弱束缚的s1/2质子有关，这个质子减少了库伦排斥因而强烈影响了对应核的镜像质量差。

On the other hand, for light nuclei the MED’s have been discussed in the relation with the loosely bound s1/2 proton, which reduces the Coulomb repulsion and  hence strongly influences the MED’s of the corresponding nuclei.

sd壳的镜像质量差相比于fp壳可能有不同的起源。

We remark that  the MED’s in the sd-shell could have a different origin from that in the fp-shell.

鉴于合适的放射性和ISB效应，超允许β衰变在检验CKM混合矩阵元Vud精确值中扮演者重要角色。

Superallowed Fermi beta-decay serves as a crucial nuclear input to test the precise values of the CKM mixing matrix element Vud between the u and d quarks, provided that the radiative and ISB effects are considered properly.

在大多数实验和理论中，ISB的修正小于2%，核素无关的Ft值被认为是常数。

In most experiments and theories, the correction due to ISB is known to be smaller than 2%, the nucleus-indepent Ft values are found to be consistent.

然而，最近在32Cl和31Cl的超允许费米beta跃迁中，发现了很大的ISB效应。

However, recent data have indicated an anomalously large ISB effect in the superallowed Fermi beta-decay of 32Cl and 31Cl.

32Cl到32S的IAS态产生5.3%的修正项目，31Cl到31S的较大的同位旋混合也被观测到。

An unusually large correction 5.3% has been reported for the Fermi beta decay form 32Cl to the T=1 isobaric analog state in 32S, and  a large isospin mixing has been observed for the beta-decay from 31Cl to the T=3/2 IAS in 31S.

这些结果可能依赖于同位旋不守恒力和混合的态的位置。

It should be noted that these results may depend on both INC force and location of the states that mix.

态间的近简并能够提高同位旋混合，这一点并不需要很强的同位旋不守恒力。

An accidental near-degeneracy of the states could enhance isospin mixing,without requiring a particularly strong INC force.

利用超允许费米跃迁的实验数据，通过微扰理论，能够用来提取同位旋非守恒力混合矩阵元。

This can be estimated by using the perturbation theory, which, subsequently, can be applied to extract the INC mixing matrix element from the experimental data of the superallowed Fermi beta-decays.

A=23的较强的同位旋混合依旧很有争议。关于上述的一个一致性的理解要求sd壳的细致的壳模型计算。

Furthermore，the observation of the strong isospin mixing for A=23 is still controversial. A consistent understanding of all the above requires detailed shell-model calculations for the sd-shell region.

为了理解超允许费米beta跃迁的异常，我们调研了库伦置换能查和三态置换能差。

In order to understand these anomalies in the superallowed Fermi beta-decay, we first investigate CDE’s and TDE’s for ground and isobaric analogue states in an isospin multiplet for the total isospin T, with Tz=(N-Z)/2 specifying different states of isospin projection in the multiplet. CDE and TDE are defined as

BE为负的基态和激发态的结合能。因此在CDE中，质子与中子进行交换，Tz> 为较大z的同重核。 

Where BE are the negative binding energies of ground and isobaric analogue states. Here in the CDE’s p protons exchange with neutrons, and Tz> is the Tz for the large Z isobar in a mirror pair.

从定义中可以看到，第一个是镜像结合能差异，第二个仅仅对三重态有意义。

From the definitions , one sees that while the first quantity resembles differences in mirror binding energies, the second is meaningful only for triplets. 

在我们的标记中，同位旋多重态的自旋和宇称被暗中包含了但是在上述表示式中被简化忽略了。

In our notation, the total spin and parity Ipi of the isobaric multiplets are implicitly included, but omitted in above equations for simplicity.

在图一中，实验的sd壳的CDE被展示，结合能是Tz=+-1/2的基态对的结合能。

In fig1, the experimental CDE’s for the sd-shell with T=-Tz>=,p=1 are shown, where the binding energies are those of the ground states of a mirror pair with Tz=+1/2.



我们执行了壳模型计算，考虑了电荷无关相互作用、T=1，j=0的同位旋矢量和张量相互作用。

In the following, we perform shell-model calculations with the charge-independent interaction USDA(H0) and additional isovector and isotensor T=1,J=0 INC interaction(HINC).
